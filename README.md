## Project Overview

This project transforms a Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero into a powerful Bluetooth media controller with:
- Media control (play/pause, next/previous track, volume)
- Deep sleep for power saving (2-minute timeout)
- Visual feedback via RGB LEDs
- Modified RM-MC25C functionality with additional features
- Customizable button actions (including modifier key combinations)
- Smart power management using USB-C LiPo charger module

## Hardware Requirements

### Components
- Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero (Main controller)
- LiPo battery (3.7V, 500mAh+ recommended)
- USB-C LiPo Charger/Booster Module (like https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B09YD5C9QC)
- Tactile buttons (x5)
- NeoPixel LED (optional)
- Resistors (10kŒ© for pull-ups)
- JST PH 2.0 connector (for battery)

### Power Setup
The USB-C LiPo Charger Module provides:
- Built-in charging circuit (no separate TP4056 needed)
- 5V boost output (powers ESP32 directly)
- On/off button functionality

Special wiring:
- ESP32 5V/GND connected to module's boosted 5V output
- DOWN button wired to charger module's power button pin
  - Single press: Turns power on/off
  - Still functions as modifier button when powered on

| DOWN   | 7    | Modifier/Power         |
| PLAY   | 9    | Play/Pause             |
| BACK   | 10   | Previous Track/Vol-    |
| NEXT   | 11   | Next Track/Vol+        |
| STOP   | 12   | Stop/Wake-up           |

### RGB LED Connections
- Red LED: GPIO 6
- Blue LED: GPIO 5
- Green LED: GPIO 4
- NeoPixel: GPIO 21

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Bluetooth LE keyboard emulation
- Media control shortcuts inspired by RM-MC25C
- Enhanced with modern ESP32-S3 capabilities
- Visual status indicators

## Installation

1. Hardware Setup:
   - Solder components according to wiring diagram
   - Ensure proper polarity for battery connections

2. Software Setup:
   - Install required Arduino libraries:
     - Adafruit_NeoPixel
     - BleKeyboard

3. Upload the Sketch:

   - Select ESP32-S3 board
   - Upload to device

## Usage

1. Power On: Press DOWN button once
2. Pairing: Connect via Bluetooth as "RM-MC25C Media Controller"
3. Controls:
   - Standard button presses for media control
   - DOWN + other buttons for secondary functions
4. Power Off: Press DOWN button twice quickly

## Customization Options

- Change timeout duration in code
- Adjust LED colors
- Modify button mappings
- Create custom enclosure

## Technical Specifications

Bluetooth: BLE 4.2
Operating Voltage: 3.3V (regulated from 5V boost)
Current Draw: ~15mA active, ~5ŒºA sleep
Battery Life: ~20 hours (500mAh LiPo)
