## Project Overview

This project transforms a Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero into a powerful Bluetooth media controller with:
- Media control (play/pause, next/previous track, volume)
- Deep sleep for power saving (2-minute timeout)
- Visual feedback via RGB LEDs
- Modified RM-MC25C functionality with additional features
- Customizable button actions (including modifier key combinations)
- Smart power management using USB-C LiPo charger module

## Hardware Requirements

### Components
- Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero (Main controller)
- LiPo battery (3.7V, 500mAh+ recommended)
- USB-C LiPo Charger/Booster Module (like https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B09YD5C9QC)
- Tactile buttons (x5)
- NeoPixel LED (optional)
- Resistors (10kŒ© for pull-ups)
- JST PH 2.0 connector (for battery)

### Power Setup
The USB-C LiPo Charger Module provides:
- Built-in charging circuit (no separate TP4056 needed)
- 5V boost output (powers ESP32 directly)
- On/off button functionality

Special wiring:
- ESP32 5V/GND connected to module's boosted 5V output
- DOWN button wired to charger module's power button pin
  - Single press: Turns power on/off
  - Still functions as modifier button when powered on

|--------|------|------------------------|
| DOWN   | 7    | Modifier/Power         |
| PLAY   | 9    | Play/Pause             |
| BACK   | 10   | Previous Track/Vol-    |
| NEXT   | 11   | Next Track/Vol+        |
| STOP   | 12   | Stop/Wake-up           |

### RGB LED Connections
- Red LED: GPIO 6
- Blue LED: GPIO 5
- Green LED: GPIO 4
- NeoPixel: GPIO 21

### Troubleshooting: False Wake-Ups from Deep Sleep

If your ESP32 randomly wakes from deep sleep shortly after entering it (especially when using GPIO12 as the wake-up trigger), follow these steps to resolve electrical noise issues:

Recommended Fix
Hardware Modifications (Required for GPIO12):

Add a 10kŒ© pull-up resistor between GPIO12 and 3.3V.

Add a 100nF ceramic capacitor between GPIO12 and GND (for debouncing).

Circuit Diagram:
```
[3.3V] ----[10kŒ©]----.
                     |
GPIO12 --------------+
                     |
                    [ ] STOP button (to GND)
                     |
                   [100nF]
                     |
                   [GND]
```

Software Configuration:
In setup(), add these lines to stabilize the wake-up pin:

```
void setup() {
...
  pinMode(STOP, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Enable internal pull-up
  gpio_pullup_en(GPIO_NUM_12);  // Force strong pull-up
  esp_sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup(GPIO_NUM_12, LOW);  // Wake on LOW (button press)
...
```

Why This Happens
ESP32 wake-up pins are sensitive to noise (floating voltages, EMI, or button bounce).

The 10kŒ© resistor ensures a clean HIGH state, while the 100nF capacitor filters noise.

If Issues Persist
Use a multimeter to verify GPIO12 voltage:

Should read ~3.3V when idle (no button press).

Should read 0V when pressed.

Shorten wires between the button and ESP32.

Replace the tactile switch (defective switches can cause floating signals).
